# California Housing Prices Regression

In this project I go throgh a simple machine learning workflow and evaluate if a linear regression model would be a good model to use to predict the target variable Median House prices.

For simplicity I used every other column in the dataset as the feautres.

The steps taken in this analysis were:

1. Splitting the data into training and test sets (could have been done later) to use to train and evaluate the model. This is a supervised learning model so this step is important.
2. Exploring the data to understand the dataset and gain insight into the variables.
3. Preprocessed the data for training. Here skewed data was log transformed and a categorical variable was one-hot-encoded.
4. Engineered some features, created some new features from features that were not particualrly interesting and added them as features into the dataset.
6. Trained the regression model and scored its predective capabilities

## Conclusion

The models score was approximately 0.66 which makes it a solid model, in an ideal world we would train other models on the data and use a better scoring model.

# Blog Post

I wrote a blog post explainng the process and you can find it on this issue of my newsletter [On Data and Stories](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/california-housing-prices-introductory-machine-ayomide-aremu-cole-lg3ue/?trackingId=If4zwxpqRr2xGLg8w0MZTQ%3D%3D).
